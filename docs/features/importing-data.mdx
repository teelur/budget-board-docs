# Importing data

## Import via CSV

CSV files can be used to bulk import transactions.

### Before you start

If you're importing transactions for an account that hasn't been added to Budget Board yet, manually create the account first. Do this on the `Accounts Configuration` page by clicking the gear icon on the Accounts card in the Dashboard.

:::tip
The name of the target account does not need to match the account name in the CSV file. You'll map the account during import.
:::

### Check your CSV format

The CSV file must contain a header row with columns that define one or more of the following fields:

- Date
- Description
- Category
- Amount

:::note
The file must also contain a column specifying the account name for each transaction.
:::

:::warning
The Category field must match an existing category in Budget Board. If it doesn't, the transaction will be imported without a category.
:::

Here is an example file:

```csv title="transactions.csv"
"Date";"Description";"Category";"Amount";"Account"
"2023-01-01";"Starbucks";"Restaurants";"-5.00";"Chase"
"2023-01-02";"Whole Foods";"Groceries";"-50.00";"Chase"
"2023-01-03";"Paycheck";"Income";"2000.00";"Chase"
```

### Upload the file

Navigate to the `Transactions` page and click the `Import` button.

Before selecting your CSV file, ensure the delimiter matches the one used in your file (for example, semicolon `;` or comma `,`). Then select your CSV file.

### Map the fields

In the `Column Fields` section, map CSV columns to transaction fields in Budget Board. If a CSV column matches a required field, it will be mapped automatically.

After mapping fields, a preview of the transactions to be imported appears in the `Transactions` section above.

### Adjust options

The `Column Options` section contains additional settings for the import.

#### Date format

Specify the date format used in your CSV file.

#### Invert amount

If amounts in your CSV are inverted (for example, expenses are positive and income is negative), enable this option to correct them during import.

#### Split income/expenses into separate columns

If your CSV has separate columns for income and expenses, enable this option and map the appropriate columns. Budget Board will categorize transactions as income or expenses based on those values.

#### Include income/expenses column

If your CSV contains a column that indicates whether a transaction is income or expense, enable this option and map that column. Specify which values denote expenses; all other values will be considered income.

#### Filter duplicates

If you're importing into an account that already contains transactions, enable this option to filter out duplicates. Choose which columns should be used to detect duplicates.

### Map the accounts

In the `Account Mapping` section, map account names from your CSV to accounts in Budget Board.

### Import the transactions

Once the previous steps are complete, the `Import` button will be enabled and will show the number of transactions to be imported. Click it to start the import process.
