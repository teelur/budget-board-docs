### Net Worth Widget

The Net Worth widget can be used to aggregate the balances of multiple accounts or assets to give you a quick overview of your total financial standing. You can add or remove accounts from this widget by clicking the settings icon on the widget itself.

Each line will aggregate values that can be grouped by the following criteria:

- **Account Type**: Group accounts by their type (e.g., checking, savings, credit card).
- **Assets**: Group all of your asset values together.
- **Line Name**: Group other line values by their name.
