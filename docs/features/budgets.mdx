# Budgets

Budgets allow you to set targets for your different transaction categories, and track your progress toward those targets over the month.

You can manage your budgets by navigating to the `Budgets` page (click the calculator icon in the sidebar).

## Creating budgets

To create a new budget, click on the plus icon on the top right of the `Budgets` page. Fill out the form with the budget details:

- **Category**: Select the transaction category you want to set a budget for.
  - You can create budgets for both parent and child categories.
  - Child category budgets will be tracked separately from their parent category and will roll into the parent category's total.
- **Amount**: Specify the target amount for the budget.

## Tracking progress

### Budget types

Budgets can be of two types:

- **Income**: These budgets track your income for the month. The goal is to meet or exceed the specified amount.
  - All budgets attached to income categories will be treated as income budgets.
- **Expense**: These budgets track your expenses in the selected category. The goal is to stay under the specified amount.
  - All budgets attached to non-income categories will be treated as expense budgets.

### Budget colors

Budgets are color-coded based on your progress. The colors are different for income and expense budgets.

#### Income budgets

- **Green**: You have met or exceeded your income target.
- **Blue**: You haven't yet met your income target.

#### Expense budgets

- **Green**: You are well below your expense target.
- **Yellow**: You are approaching your expense target. The threshold for this color is configurable in the settings (See below).
- **Red**: You have exceeded your expense target.

#### Unbudgeted categories

If you have transactions in a category that does not have a budget, it will be shown in one of two places.

:::tip
You can create budgets for these categories by clicking the plus icon on the unbudgeted category. This will create a new budget for the category with an initial amount of the current spending.

#### Unbudgeted parent categories

If the category is a parent category or a child category with no parent budget, it will be shown in the `Unbudgeted` section at the bottom of the budgets list.

#### Unbudgeted child categories

If the category is a child category with a parent budget, it will be shown under the parent category in the budgets list.

## Budget settings

You can configure some settings for budgets by clicking the gear icon on the top right of the `Budgets` page.

### Warning threshold

This setting controls the threshold at which a expense budget changes from green to yellow. For example, if the threshold is set to 80%, an expense budget will turn yellow when you have spent 80% of the budgeted amount.

## Budget summary

At the top of the right column on the `Budgets` page, you will see a summary of your budgets for the month. This includes:

- **Total Income**: The total progress of income budgets for the month.
- **Total Expenses**: The total progress of expense budgets for the month.
- **Unbudgeted**: The total of all unbudgeted expenses for the month as compared to the total unbudgeted income for the month (i.e. Income budgets - Expense budgets).
- **Net Cash Flow**: The net cash flow for the month, calculated as Total Income - Total Expenses + Unbudgeted.

## Aggregating budgets

By default, the budgets page will show budgets for the current month. You can change this to show budgets for a different month or to aggregate budgets over multiple months.

To change the selected month, use the toolbar at the top of the `Budgets` page.

To select multiple months, click the `Select Multiple` button in the toolbar. Then, click on the months you want to include in the aggregation. Click the button again to return to single month view.

:::note
When aggregating over multiple months, you will not be able to edit/add budgets or view budget details.

## Budget details

To view the details of a budget, click on the budget in the list. This will open a side panel with more information about the budget.

### Expense trends

This section shows a bar chart of your expenses in the selected category over the past 6 months. It will also display an average spending over this time period. This can help you see trends in your spending and adjust your budget accordingly.

### Recent transactions

This section shows a list of recent transactions in the selected category. This can help you see where your money is going and identify any unexpected expenses.

You can edit transactions from this panel just as you would on the `Transactions` page.
