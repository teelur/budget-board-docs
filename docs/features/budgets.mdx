# Budgets

Budgets let you set targets for transaction categories and track progress toward those targets over the month.

Manage budgets on the `Budgets` page (click the calculator icon in the sidebar).

## Creating budgets

To create a new budget, click the plus icon in the top-right of the `Budgets` page. Fill out the form with the budget details:

- **Category**: Select the transaction category to budget.
  - You can create budgets for parent and child categories.
  - Child-category budgets are tracked separately and roll up into the parent category's total.
- **Amount**: Specify the target amount for the budget.

## Tracking progress

### Budget types

Budgets are of two types:

- **Income**: Tracks income for the month. The goal is to meet or exceed the amount.
  - Budgets attached to income categories are treated as income budgets.
- **Expense**: Tracks expenses in the selected category. The goal is to stay under the specified amount.
  - Budgets attached to non-income categories are treated as expense budgets.

### Budget colors

Budgets are color-coded based on progress. The colors differ for income and expense budgets.

#### Income budgets

- **Green**: You have met or exceeded the income target.
- **Blue**: You have not yet met the income target.

#### Expense budgets

- **Green**: You are well below the expense target.
- **Yellow**: You are approaching the expense target. The threshold for this color is configurable in settings (see below).
- **Red**: You have exceeded the expense target.

#### Unbudgeted categories

Transactions in categories without a budget appear in one of two places.

:::tip
Create a budget for an unbudgeted category by clicking the plus icon next to it. This creates a new budget prefilled with the current spending as the initial amount.

#### Unbudgeted parent categories

If the category is a parent, or a child with no parent budget, it appears in the `Unbudgeted` section at the bottom of the budgets list.

#### Unbudgeted child categories

If the category is a child and its parent has a budget, it appears under the parent category in the budgets list.

## Budget settings

Configure budget settings by clicking the gear icon in the top-right of the `Budgets` page.

### Warning threshold

This setting controls when an expense budget changes from green to yellow. For example, if the threshold is 80%, an expense budget turns yellow when you reach 80% of the budgeted amount.

## Budget summary

At the top of the right column on the `Budgets` page, you'll see a summary for the month:

- **Total Income**: Combined progress of income budgets for the month.
- **Total Expenses**: Combined progress of expense budgets for the month.
- **Unbudgeted**: Net unbudgeted amount (unbudgeted income minus unbudgeted expenses).
- **Net Cash Flow**: Calculated as Total Income - Total Expenses + Unbudgeted.

## Aggregating budgets

By default the Budgets page shows the current month. You can view a different month or aggregate multiple months.

Change the selected month using the toolbar at the top of the `Budgets` page.

To select multiple months, click the `Select Multiple` button in the toolbar, then click the months to include. Click the button again to return to single-month view.

:::note
When aggregating multiple months you cannot add/edit budgets or view budget details.
