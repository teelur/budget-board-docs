# Goals

Budget Board allows you to set financial goals and track your progress toward them. Goals can be based on a target amount or a target date.

Manage goals on the `Goals` page (click the flag icon in the sidebar).

## Creating goals

To create a new goal, click the plus icon in the top-right of the `Goals` page. Fill out the form with the goal details.

### Goal types

Goals can be one of two types:

- **Savings**: Set a target amount you want to save.
- **Debt payoff**: Set a target amount you want to pay off.

### Goal details

Fill out the following required fields:

- **Name**: Enter a name for the goal.
- **Accounts**: Select one or more accounts to associate with the goal. The balances of these accounts are used to track progress toward the goal.
- **Target amount**: Specify the amount you want to save or pay off.
  - For debt payoff goals, this is typically the remaining balance (often zero).
- **Apply existing balance toward goal**: If enabled, the current balance of the selected accounts will be applied toward the goal immediately upon creation.
  - Useful for existing savings you want included in the goal.

### Goal options

A goal can be configured with either a specific target date or a monthly contribution target. Specifying one will calculate the other based on your current progress.

## Tracking progress

Goals show progress as a percentage of the target amount. You can view progress over time and see how close you are to reaching the goal.

### Include interest

By default, goals do not account for interest earned on accounts associated with the goal. To include interest in goal calculations, enable the `Include interest` option (button in the top-right). This uses the interest rates specified on the `Accounts` page to project future balances and adjust the target date or monthly contribution accordingly.

## Editing goals

To edit a goal, click the edit button (pencil icon) next to the goal name and make changes in the form that appears.

:::note
You can only edit the target type that was set during goal creation (either target date or monthly contribution). The other value is always calculated.

## Goal details

Click a goal to open a side panel with more information.

### Accounts

View details about the accounts associated with the goal, including current balance and last balance date.

### Goal trends

View a chart of your goal progress over time, broken down by account. The chart can be set to 3-, 6-, or 12-month views.

## Completing goals

When you reach your goal, mark it complete by clicking the `Mark as Complete` button in the top-right of the goal details panel. Goals are also marked complete automatically during sync if the balances of the associated accounts reach the target amount.

Completed goals appear in the `Completed` section at the bottom of the `Goals` page.
