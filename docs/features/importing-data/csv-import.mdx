# Import via CSV

CSV files can be used to bulk-import transactions.

## Before you start

### Ensure accounts are created

If you're importing transactions for an account that hasn't been added to Budget Board yet, create the account first on the `Accounts Configuration` page (click the gear icon on the Accounts card in the Dashboard).

:::tip
The target account name does not need to match the account name in the CSV file. You'll map the account during import.
:::

### Check your CSV format

The CSV file must contain a header row. It must include a column specifying the account name for each transaction, and one or more of the following fields:

- Date
- Description
- Category
- Amount

:::note
The Category field must match an existing category in Budget Board. If it doesn't, the transaction will be imported without a category.
:::

Example CSV file:

```mdx-code-block
import ExampleCsv from "@site/src/components/ExampleCsv";

<ExampleCsv />
```

## Load the CSV file

Navigate to the `Transactions` page and click `Import`.

Click the file input field to select your CSV file, then click `Load CSV` to load it.

:::note
Budget Board will try to automatically detect the delimiter used in your CSV file (comma, semicolon, tab, etc.). If it fails, you can manually select the correct delimiter by selecting `Specify Delimiter` and entering your delimiter in the field.
:::

## Configure Transactions

You will use the next screen to configure how the CSV data is imported. The `Next` button will be disabled until all required fields are mapped and there are no warnings.

### Map the fields

In the `Column Fields` section, map CSV columns to transaction fields in Budget Board. Columns that match required fields will be mapped automatically.

After mapping, a preview of the transactions to be imported appears in the `Transactions` section above. Some fields are required, so ensure there are no warnings above the preview table before proceeding.

### Adjust options

The `Column Options` section contains additional import settings.

#### Date format

Specify the date format used in your CSV file.

#### Invert amount

If amounts in your CSV are inverted (for example, expenses are positive and income is negative), enable this option to correct them during import.

#### Split income/expenses into separate columns

If your CSV has separate columns for income and expenses, enable this option and map the appropriate columns. Budget Board will categorize transactions as income or expenses based on those columns' values.

#### Include income/expenses column

If your CSV contains a column indicating whether a transaction is income or expense, enable this option and map that column. Specify which values denote expenses; all other values will be treated as income.

#### Filter duplicates

If you're importing into an account that already contains transactions, enable this option to filter duplicates. Choose which columns should be used to detect duplicates.

## Map accounts

In the `Account Mapping` section, map account names from your CSV to accounts in Budget Board.

## Import the transactions

Once the previous steps are complete, the `Import` button will be enabled and will show the number of transactions to be imported. Click it to start the import process.
