# SimpleFIN Sync

Budget Board can sync with [SimpleFIN](https://simplefin.com/), a third-party service that connects to your bank accounts and imports transactions.

## Getting Started

### Setting up SimpleFIN

To use SimpleFIN with Budget Board, you need to set up a [SimpleFIN Bridge](https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/) account. This service securely connects to your bank and provides access tokens for third-party applications like Budget Board.

1. Go to [SimpleFIN Bridge](https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/) and create an account.
2. After logging in, you will want to connect your bank account by following the prompts in SimpleFIN.
3. Once your bank accounts are connected, click the `New Connection` button under Apps to generate an access token.
4. Copy the generated access token.

### Linking SimpleFIN to Budget Board

You will need your newly created access token to link SimpleFIN to Budget Board.

1. In Budget Board, navigate to the `Settings` page.
2. Find the `Link SimpleFIN` section.
3. Paste the access token you copied from SimpleFIN Bridge into the input field.
4. Click `Save Changes`. If successful, the section will show `Linked`.

## Advanced Configuration

### Force Sync Lookback Period

By default, Budget Board handles the lookback period for requesting transactions from SimpleFIN. However, you can override this by specifying a custom lookback period in days. This is useful if you want to re-import older transactions.

To do this:

1. In Budget Board, navigate to the `Settings` page.
2. Find the `Advanced Settings` section, and look for the `Force Sync Lookback Period` field.
3. Select the desired lookback period from the dropdown menu.
4. Run a sync to apply the new lookback period.

:::note
Larger lookback periods take longer to sync, as more transactions need to be fetched and processed. It's recommended to use the default setting unless you have a specific need for a longer lookback.
