# SimpleFIN Sync

Budget Board can sync with [SimpleFIN](https://simplefin.com/), a third‑party service that connects to your bank and imports transactions.

## Getting Started

### Setting up SimpleFIN

To use SimpleFIN with Budget Board, set up a [SimpleFIN Bridge](https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/) account. This service securely connects to your bank and provides access tokens for third‑party applications like Budget Board.

1. Go to [SimpleFIN Bridge](https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/) and create an account.
2. After logging in, connect your bank account by following the prompts in SimpleFIN.
3. In SimpleFIN, click the "New Connection" button under "Apps" to generate an access token.
4. Copy the generated access token.

### Linking SimpleFIN to Budget Board

Use the access token to link SimpleFIN to Budget Board:

1. In Budget Board, open the Settings page.
2. Find the "Link SimpleFIN" section.
3. Paste the access token from SimpleFIN Bridge into the input field.
4. Click "Save Changes". If successful, the section will display "Linked".

## Advanced Configuration

### Force Sync Lookback Period

By default, Budget Board determines the lookback period used when requesting transactions from SimpleFIN. You can override this and specify a custom lookback period (in days) to re‑import older transactions.

To change the lookback period:

1. In Budget Board, open the Settings page.
2. Under Advanced Settings, find the "Force Sync Lookback Period" field.
3. Choose the desired lookback period from the dropdown.
4. Run a sync to apply the new lookback period.

:::note
Larger lookback periods take longer to sync because more transactions must be fetched and processed. It is recommended to use the default setting unless you need a longer history.
