# Deploy

## Deploy with Docker Compose

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.

### Sync the compose files to your machine

On macOS or Linux, you can download the compose files with:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teelur/budget-board/refs/heads/main/compose.yml && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teelur/budget-board/refs/heads/main/compose.override.yml
```

On Windows (PowerShell), use:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/compose.yml
Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile compose.override.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/compose.override.yml
```

`compose.yml` contains the base configuration; `compose.override.yml` contains variables you should edit.

```mdx-code-block
import ComposeFiles from "@site/src/components/ComposeFiles";

<ComposeFiles />
```

### Edit the variables in `compose.override.yml`

For a quick demo the compose files work out of the box. For production, edit the variables in `compose.override.yml` to suit your environment.

It's strongly recommended to change the default passwords and to configure email settings for account verification and password recovery. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for details.

### Deploy

Run the following command to start the services in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Access

You can access the app by navigating to the following url in your browser:

```
http://{machine-ip-address}:6253
```
