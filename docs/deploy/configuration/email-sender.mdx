# Email Sender

The env file contains settings to configure an email sender for password resets and account verification. This is optional but highly recommended for deployments that don't use OIDC.

You will need an SMTP server to send email. You can use a self-hosted service, a paid cloud service, or a provider such as Gmail for small deployments.

If you plan to use Gmail, consult Google's documentation for enabling SMTP access and generating app-specific credentials where required.

:::warning
If you don't configure an SMTP server, users have no convenient way to recover a lost password. You would need to edit the database directly to set a new hashed password.
