# Localization Support, Customizable Net Worth Card, and UI Improvements

## New Features

### Localization Support

Added support for multiple languages! Users can now select their preferred language from the settings menu. If set to `System Default`, Budget Board will use the browser's language settings.

Currently, Budget Board only includes US English translations. However, we welcome contributions for additional languages. If you're interested in helping with translations, please check out our [localization guide](../contributing/translations.mdx) in the wiki.

### Customizable Net Worth Card

Users can now customize the Net Worth card on the dashboard. You can choose which accounts to include in the net worth calculation and adjust the display settings to your preference.

### UI Improvements

This update brings an overhaul to the UI to improve consistency across the application. Colors have been tweaked for better visibility and aesthetics, and several components have been refined to enhance the overall user experience.

#### Dark Mode

The dark mode color scheme has been update for better contrast and a more consistant shading heirarchy.

##### New Dark Mode UI

#### Light Mode

The biggest changes were to the light mode color scheme, making it a bit more visually appealing and consistent with the dark mode shading.

## What's Next

### New Bank Sync Provider Support

In the next release, I plan on focusing on implementing a new bank sync provider, [LunchFlow](https://lunchflow.app/). This will require a new page to manage bank sync provider connections, and a new feature to map accounts from different providers to Budget Board accounts.

### Customizable Dashboard

After the bank sync provider improvements, I am hoping to build on what was done for the Net Worth card and allow users to customize their entire dashboard. This would include adding/removing cards, rearranging them, and possibly resizing them. This will likely be completed in stages over multiple releases.
