# Quick Start

## Deploy with Docker Compose

### Sync the compose files to your machine.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/compose.yml && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/compose.override.yml
```

`compose.yml` contains the base configuration, while `compose.override.yml` contains variables you need to edit.

```mdx-code-block
import ComposeFiles from "@site/src/components/ComposeFiles";

<ComposeFiles />
```

### Edit the variables in `compose.override.yml`

If you are just demoing, the compose files will work out of the box. However, if you are deploying to production, you should edit the variables in `compose.override.yml` to suit your needs.

It's strongly recommended to change the default passwords, and to configure email settings for account verification and password recovery. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for more details.

3. Deploy using the command:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
